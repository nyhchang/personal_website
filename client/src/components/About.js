          <p>I'm an up and coming web developer, looking to build useful, functional, and compact websites. I initially graduated from Cal Poly
            San Luis Obispo with a B.S in Biochemistry, but after a couple years in the lab, found my passion in software. I was then accepted to
            Oregon State University's Computer Science program. I graduated from Oregon State University in 2019 with a B.S in Computer Science,
            and am currently building my career looking for work and internships. </p>
